## SecureBlock: Trust Through ECDSA Node

SecureBlock is a project that combines the power of cryptography and blockchain technology. With an ECDSA Node at its core, SecureBlock facilitates secure and tamper-proof transactions between accounts. By leveraging the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), SecureBlock ensures the integrity and authenticity of each transaction, fostering a reliable and trustworthy environment.

Through a user-friendly React front-end, SecureBlock enables seamless interaction with the network, allowing users to initiate transfers and manage their balances. While operating with a centralized server for learning purposes, SecureBlock offers valuable insights into the fundamentals of blockchain development.

SecureBlock serves as a stepping stone for aspiring blockchain developers, offering hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of decentralized systems. By exploring the intricacies of transactions, digital signatures, and blockchains, SecureBlock equips users with the knowledge and skills to comprehend the transformative potential of blockchain technology.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server 

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically! 

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.
